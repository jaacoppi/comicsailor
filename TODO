# TODO / Roadmap

- display all comics and info without crashing the app (includes proper error checking)
- better UI: show all text properly
- landscape orientation and zooming of comics
- ability to save reading progress of a comic
- more comics
- making sure all comic licenses are strictly followed
- a desktop icon 
	- I won't be doing it but if someone wants to submit an icon that's fine. Preferably something like either of these two:
		- a stick figure with a mobile phone in a comic strip
		- a Comic Sailor, pun intended
- proper QML / C++ integration - removal of spaghetti code
- Jolla Harbour package
