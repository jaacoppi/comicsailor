# About
Comic Sailor is used to read webcomics on SailfishOS mobile devices.

** IMPORTANT **
Comic Sailor is still in early development and not ready for daily use. There are many bugs that cause crashes as well as other annoyances. Tested only on the Sailfish SDK emulator..

Source code can be found in github: http://github.com/jaacoppi/comicsailor

# Supported comics 
Currently XKCD works best, other comics are unreliable.

- XKCD: http://www.xkcd.com
- Diesel Sweeties: http://www.dieselsweeties.com
- Spiked Math: http://www.spikedmath.com
- Peebles Lab: http://www.peebleslab.com
(Comic Sailor doesn't check for updates for Peebles Lab since it appears to be discontinued)

More comics will be added later.

If you are a comic author and wish to include OR exclude your comic from the app, contact me. If you are a user and want to read your favorite non-creative commons comic with Comic Sailor, ask the author of the comic for permission and notify me.
