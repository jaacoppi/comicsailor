# About
Comic Sailor is used to read webcomics on SailfishOS mobile devices.

** IMPORTANT **
Comic Sailor is still in early development. There are many bugs that cause crashes as well as other annoyances.

Source code can be found in github: http://github.com/jaacoppi/comicsailor. 
Installable rpm package can be found in openrepos: https://openrepos.net/content/jaacoppi/comic-sailor

# Supported comics 
Currently XKCD works best, other comics are a bit unreliable.

- XKCD: http://www.xkcd.com
- Diesel Sweeties: http://www.dieselsweeties.com
- Spiked Math: http://www.spikedmath.com
- Peebles Lab: http://www.peebleslab.com
(Comic Sailor doesn't check for updates for Peebles Lab since it appears to be discontinued)

More comics will be added later.

If you are a comic author and wish to include or exclude your comic from the app, contact me. If you are a user and want to read your favorite non-creative commons comic with Comic Sailor, ask the author of the comic for permission and notify me.

# Technical
Comic Sailor uses these libraries to handle downloading the content:
- libcurl

Comic Sailor does not save copies of any comics. The list of available comic strips will be dynamically generated by parsing the comic websites. If a comic changes the website structure, Comic Sailor stops working.
